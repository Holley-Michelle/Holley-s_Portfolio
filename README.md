# Holley-s_SQL-Projects

Knowing how to create a custom database using SQL is a valuable skill in any data professional's toolkit. In this example, I’ve combined database design with storytelling by using the characters and plot from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice to build a simple yet illustrative database.

Visual story telling is an essential part of data anlaytics and as an analyst we know that data tells a story. However, we often over look the reverse of this, all story has its data. In this example I've distilled infomation from Pride and Prejudice and created a database summarizing that information. 

NOTE: This is a tutorial set up for junior analysts I mentor to learn and practice SQL, do to the nature of my professional work no professional projects reside on this site.
