Project 1 - Pride_and_Prejudice_and_SQL - Creating a SQL Database
Knowing how to create a custom database using SQL is a valuable skill in any data professional's toolkit. In this example, I’ve combined database design with storytelling by using the characters and plot from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice to build a simple yet illustrative database.

Visual story telling is an essential part of data anlaytics and as an analyst we know that data tells a story. However, we often over look the reverse of this, all story has its data. In this example I've distilled infomation from Pride and Prejudice and created a database with tables for the following: 
1-Character Demographics
2-Household Data
3-Income and/or Dowry Information
4-Narraitve Parts

Project 1 sets this up I'll expand upon this information in later projects.
